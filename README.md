# MinesweeperAtHome

A Minesweeper clone written in Java. It works, but is missing some features and some parts of the code are rather messy.

Use 'D' to dig, 'F' to flag, and 'R' to reset the round.

Roadmap:
* Movement using arrow keys. 
* Rethink class structure. There are many oddities due to the current division of responsibility between classes.
* Clean up the code. 
* Make the UI nice. 
* Map generation that never creates situations where the player has to rely on chance. 

Fun ideas for future development:
* Infinite chunk-wise map-generation, think `Minecraft`.
* Fake 3D rendering making it look like a table-top game. Think `Don't Starve`.

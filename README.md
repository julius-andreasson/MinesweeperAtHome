# MinesweeperAtHome

A Minesweeper clone written in Java. 

Use 'D' to dig, 'F' to flag, and 'R' to reset the round.

Roadmap:
* Movement using arrow keys. 
* Rethink class structure. There are many oddities due to the current division of responsibility between classes.
* Clean up the code. 
* Make the UI nice. 
* Map generation that never creates situations where the player has to rely on chance. 

Fun ideas for future development:
* Infinite chunk-wise map-generation, think `Minecraft`.
* Fake 3D rendering making it look like a table-top game. Think `Don't Starve`.

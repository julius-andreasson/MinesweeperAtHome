You: Mom, can we get Minesweeper?

Mom: No, we have Minesweeper at home.

Minesweeper at home: *this mess*

Roadmap:
* Make it impossible to lose on the first click. 
* Rethink class structure.
* Clean up the code. 
* Make the UI nice. 
* Map generation that never creates situations where the player has to rely on chance.

Fun ideas:
* Infinite chunk-wise map-generation, think Minecraft. B)

A Minesweeper clone written in Java. 

Use 'D' to dig, 'F' to flag, and 'R' to reset the round.

You: Mom, can we get Minesweeper?

Mom: No, we have Minesweeper at home.

Minesweeper at home: *this mess*

|
BUGS:
* Incorrectly clears all flags around empty tiles upon 'flood-fill' mass clear.

Roadmap:
* [Done!] Make it impossible to lose on the first click. 
* Movement using arrow keys. 
* Rethink class structure.
* Clean up the code. 
* Make the UI nice. 
* Map generation that never creates situations where the player has to rely on chance.

Fun ideas:
* Infinite chunk-wise map-generation, think Minecraft. B)
